# PetWiki 
This is a website where you can get facts about cats and dogs. The website was built using C#/ASP.NET for the backend and REST API. Angular was used for the front end.
This was built for fun but also to get more comfortable with ASP.NET/Angular. Most of the time spent on this project was messing with different ways to set up (MVC,SPA,single port, back/front end on separate ports,etc)

## Data Sets
The data was grabbed from other API's. I wanted to start this project in a way that makes it easy for others to deploy.

## Run this app
Step 1: go to desired folder and type the commands:
```
	git clone https://github.com/jaredmt/PetWiki .
	dotnet run
	cd PetViews
	npm install
	ng serve --open
```

Note that both the backend and frontend must be running separately. The last command should open http://localhost:4200.
